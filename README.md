These are some examples of the homeworks and assignments that I had to do during my introductory python classes at emlyon business school. I took the course "python programming bootcamp" and the course "python for data analysis" lasting 2 months each with approx. 20h/week invested during that time. Thus, I had a total of 4 months of intense python courses. The most important libraries that we learned to work with were pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly & seaborn. We coded using the  anaconda navigator & jupyter notebook.
